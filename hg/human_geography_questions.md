Two cities, one with a large population and the other with a medium population that are very close in distance like Seattle and Tacoma, Washington</li><li>E. Two cities with medium populations that are relatively close to each other like Akron, Ohio, and Springfield, Missouri</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(D) The gravity model predicts the level of interaction between two cities in terms of their populations and distances apart from one another. The correct option has a very large numerator (product of both populations) and a very small denominator (distance between Seattle and Tacoma). Thus, the resulting level of interaction will be quite high.</p>

<li>A. the death rates</li><li>B. emigration</li><li>C. natural increase over time</li><li>D. instances when natural increase is negative</li><li>E. immigration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(C) The demographic accounting equation predicts a country's future population on the basis of current birth rates, death rates, immigration rates, and emigration rates. It is not always a very accurate prediction, because these rates can change dramatically over time.</p>

<li>A. older American cities like Boston.</li><li>B. large European cities like Madrid.</li><li>C. regionally planned Canadian cities like Toronto.</li><li>D. newer American cities like Las Vegas.</li><li>E. large South American cities like Sao Paulo.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(D) Most newer American cities, and newer areas of older American cities, have been designed to accommodate sprawling suburban housing communities and wide highways geared for automobile transportation. Although some European cities have been affected by sprawl, it is much less of a problem in countries like France and Germany, where people tend to live in older neighborhoods and the car is less important for transportation. Some Canadian cities, such as Toronto, have limited sprawl through well-coordinated urban planning.</p>

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 304</strong></p>
<p><b>1.</b> Thomas Malthus predicted that</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. technology will offset population growth.</li><li>B. the distribution of resources would be a continuing problem.</li><li>C. population would outpace food production.</li><li>D. the environment would allow less food to be grown in the future.</li><li>E. the Green Revolution would provide agricultural technology to support increasing populations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(C) Thomas Malthus predicted that food production would grow arithmetically while population would grow geometrically (exponentially). Malthus's theory has been criticized because it does not account for other factors affecting food production and population, such as technology, the distribution of food resources, personal choice, and environmental change.</p>

<li>A. San Marino</li><li>B. Nigeria</li><li>C. Denmark</li><li>D. Russia</li><li>E. Finland</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(B) In stage two of the demographic transition model, a country's population growth is high because death rates have decreased but birth rates have not. Nigeria's explosive population growth is an example of this situation. Denmark, Russia, and San Marino have all advanced to stage three, in which fertility decreases and population growth slows down.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(A) A triangle-shaped population pyramid indicates that there is a high percentage of young people in the population and that it is growing rapidly. A rectangle-shaped age-sex distribution means that the population is composed of a more even range of older and younger people and that the population is growing slowly or not at all.</p>

## Question 307

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 307</strong></p>
<p><b>4.</b> The baby boom</p>
<ul class="qlist">

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(C) The baby boom, which occurred during the years following World War II, was a national phenomenon in which economic prosperity and relative peace were accompanied by high fertility rates. Although fertility began to decline as early as the late 1940s, the baby boom generation became the most numerous, wealthiest, and most prosperous generation in American history.</p>

## Question 308

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 308</strong></p>
<p><b>5.</b> When baby boomers have reached retirement age, what will the population pyramid for the United States look like?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. An hourglass, wide at both top and bottom but narrow in the middle</li><li>B. Relatively rectangular, with a slight bulge near the top</li><li>C. Carrot-shaped, a narrow bottom and wide top</li><li>D. Pear-shaped, wide at the bottom, but narrow at the top</li><li>E. None of these</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(B) The baby boom is a large cohort of the American population, larger than the generation behind them. When they reach retirement age, their bracket, near the top of the pyramid, will most likely be larger than other segments of the pyramid. This demonstrates the magnitude of the dependency ratio, or number of individuals relying on younger, economically productive generations for support.</p>

## Question 310

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 310</strong></p>
<p><b>2.</b> Carrying capacity is a function of</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. echnology.</li><li>B. natural resources.</li><li>C. resource allocation.</li><li>D. limiting factors.</li><li>E. (A), (B), and (D)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> E</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(E) The quality and quantity of natural resources available in an area and technological innovations that help people to use those resources both affect carrying capacity. The limiting factor describes the resource in scarcest supply within a region and thus provides a method for understanding how big a population an area can adequately sustain. However, the limiting factor within a region can be extended by use of technological innovations. Because of this, carrying capacity changes over time and is notoriously hard to pin down.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> E</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(E) These two forces, births and immigration, are the largest contributors to population increase within a country. Humane population policy usually seeks to limit or decrease somehow the fertility level within a country, or it seeks to limit the number of individuals allowed into a particular country.</p>

## Question 312

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 312</strong></p>
<p><b>4.</b> India and China are the world's two most populous countries. While China has instituted a strict population policy, India</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. for cultural reasons, encourages women to continue to reproduce.</li><li>B. does not endorse birth control because of the Catholic majority.</li><li>C. encourages lower fertility through education and access to family planning.</li><li>D. has a similar policy to China.</li><li>E. because of its agricultural system, encourages reproduction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(C) Population policies implemented within countries usually reflect the country's prevailing ideologies and, thus, usually its political system. China is a communist-controlled country, which was demonstrated in their strict enforcement of their one-child policy. However, India is a democratic nation that encourages, rather than demands, lower fertility through increased education and access to family planning.</p>

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 314</strong></p>
<p><b>2.</b> Throughout history, numerous colonial powers have argued that certain types of people, living in certain areas of the world, are less able to govern themselves because of the qualities they have developed due to their interactions with natural factors, such as climate. This is an example of</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. environmental determinism.</li><li>B. cultural ecology.</li><li>C. possibilism.</li><li>D. ecumenism.</li><li>E. positivism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(A) Environmental determinism is the notion that human traits or historical events are directly attributable to environmental factors, that people's actions are determined by environmental factors. This idea has been discredited as simplistic and racist. Possibilism, the notion that humans have agency and yet are limited somewhat by the environmental surroundings, provides an attractive alternative to environmental determinism.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(C) Agribusiness has largely contributed to the demise of the family farm. As agriculture becomes increasingly controlled by large corporations that have the technology to mass produce goods without much human capital, it loses its need for human labor. Furthermore, the agricultural activities that require large amounts of labor have been relocated to parts of the globe where human labor is cheaper.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> In cities such as Baltimore, inner-city revitalization has transformed _______________ into gentrified urban neighborhoods.</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. suburbs</li><li>B. central business districts</li><li>C. edge cities</li><li>D. ghettos</li><li>E. agglomerations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(D) Ghettos are economically depressed inner-city neighborhoods often populated by ethnic minorities. During the past 20 years, many American cities have successfully revitalized their inner cities by luring young urban professionals back into funky urban neighborhoods. However, many long-time residents of these former ghettos have been forced to move owing to increasing costs of living. Other cities, such as Detroit, have had much less success at transforming their urban cores.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(B) Action spaces are used by behavioral geographers to analyze individuals' daily spatial activities. They describe all the typical interactions individuals have with their environment on any given day, and thus can provide insightful information for urban planners in making decisions on transportation routes and locations of various facilities within a city.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> E</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(E) Behavioral geographers have analyzed numerous people's action spaces to draw general conclusions about human spatial behavior on a daily basis. In general, this kind of behavior conforms to five rules: people take many more shorter trips than longer trips, most trips tend to be work-related, trips of greater distances require more thought and planning, travel decisions can be quite limited by transportation, and people tend to avoid perceived hazards when going about their daily activities.</p>

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 402</strong></p>
<p><b>2.</b> In developed countries, such as the Netherlands, it is difficult to classify agriculture as part of the primary economy. Why?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. Because agriculture in developed countries is primarily controlled by large agribusinesses that coordinate research, production, harvest, and distribution on global scales</li><li>B. Because agriculture in developed countries no longer happens in fields, but rather through almost completely through high-tech methods in factories</li><li>C. Because so little of the labor force in developed countries is engaged in this economic activity, the category essentially no longer exists</li><li>D. Because developed countries now outsource all of their agricultural production from developing countries</li><li>E. Because agricultural production is still very much a primary economic activity in developed countries, the methods are comparable to those in developing countries</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(A) In highly developed countries, such as the United States, the dependency ratio is increasing as a result of longer life expectancies and decreasing fertility rates. The rise in elderly populations has led to a corresponding rise in services that provide for the specific needs of this population. Memory care facilities and long-term care centers are becoming increasingly popular across the United States and other developed countries.</p>

## Question 408

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 408</strong></p>
<p><b>8.</b> In some spots along the Great Rift Valley, such as Rwanda in eastern Africa, population density is high despite the country's equatorial location. This density is partially attributable to</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. volcanic activity along the plate boundaries, which feeds the typically poor equatorial soil.</li><li>B. government incentives to increase population density through pronatalist policies.</li><li>C. Rwanda's size as a comparatively small country in terms of area.</li><li>D. Rwanda's location near the Indian Ocean.</li><li>E. Rwanda's proximity to the Nile River.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(A) Because of Rwanda's equatorial position, the soil quality should not allow for substantial agricultural production. However, because of volcanic activity along the Great Rift Valley, the soil is nutrient-rich, and the elevation gains are more suited for high population density than in other parts of equatorial Africa such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

There is no clear relationship between urbanization and labor-force composition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(A) Countries that are urbanized tend to have more highly educated populations that specialize in a variety of service-based occupations, jobs that typically concentrate in cities. Countries that are mostly rural have labor forces that concentrate in the agricultural sector of the economy. As countries industrialize, they also typically urbanize, as factories and associated industries tend to concentrate in urban centers.</p>

<p><strong>Question: 417</strong></p>
<p><b>2.</b> Von Thunen's model of rural land use is based on which of the following premises?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. Value of land decreases the farther it is from the urban center.</li><li>B. Value of land increases the farther it is from the urban center.</li><li>C. Perishable goods are the least valuable.</li><li>D. Railroads provide fixed transportation costs.</li><li>E. Vegetarianism is environmentally beneficial.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(A) In von Thunen's model, agricultural land use changes with distance from the city center, primarily due to land and commodity values. Expensive, perishable commodities are grown closer to urban markets, while less expensive, more expansive (in terms of land area necessary for cultivation) agricultural goods are grown farther from the city center.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Although no longer in effect, China's one-child policy has led to which of the following demographic challenges?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. Large-scale emigration to economically advanced countries</li><li>B. Mass rural-to-urban migration</li><li>C. Smaller total population in China</li><li>D. Immigration from less-developed countries to fulfill lower level industrial jobs</li><li>E. An imbalance between males and females of marrying age</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> E</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(E) China's traditionally patriarchal society favors males over females which, combined with the one-child policy and the availability of sonograms, led to a much larger portion of male births while the policy was in effect. This, in turn, has led to a huge current discrepancy between males and females of marrying age.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(A) Gentrified landscapes such as Over the Rhine attract younger, urban, often single professionals. The housing is such that it does not typically support larger families and requires a stable, significant income.

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(A) In recent decades, many Americans have become more concerned about the quality of their food and about the use of toxic pesticides in farming. This concern has led to an increase in demand for locally produced, organic farm products, which has led to greater opportunities for smaller farms that produce a wider variety of sustainably raised goods.</p>

<p><strong>Question: 437</strong></p>
<p><b>7.</b> What is most responsible for hierarchical diffusion, as opposed to contagious diffusion?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. Distance decay effects</li><li>B. Special network links between major nodes</li><li>C. Some people's need for multiple contacts before they adopt an innovation</li><li>D.

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(B) Hierarchical diffusion describes the spread of an innovation through specific nodes, which are not usually located close together in space, but exhibit strong links to one another in a network. For example, fashion trends tend to diffuse hierarchically between major fashion nodes (e.g., Paris, London, and Milan) before spreading contagiously to surrounding areas.</p>

<p><strong>Question: 440</strong></p>
<p><b>10.</b> Poorer rural-to-urban migrants in Latin America are most likely to have residences or homes</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. in slums or squatter settlements.</li><li>B. in single-family homes in the suburbs.</li><li>C. in government-provided public housing projects.</li><li>D. in high-density urban apartments.</li><li>E. in communal housing cooperatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(A) In Middle and South America, as depicted in the Ford Griffin Model of the Latin American City, poor urban inhabitants typically occupy areas on the outer fringes of the city, often in marginal landscapes. These migrants are searching for economic opportunity, often in the informal sector of the economy, and they do not have the income to afford more established housing options. Unit 6.</p>

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 446</strong></p>
<p><b>1.</b> Increased air pollution, inner-city decay, homogenization of landscapes, and loss of productive farmlands are all caused by</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. climate change.</li><li>B. postmodernism.</li><li>C. gentrification.</li><li>D. suburbanization.</li><li>E. ghettoization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(D) Suburbanization describes the process of urban areas expanding outward, converting productive farmland to housing and other services. Initially, individuals and families that moved to the suburbs commuted back to the city for work, a process accommodated by the automobile and improved highway systems. Even today, when commuting patterns don't always lead to the central business district (CBD), the suburban way of life still depends on the automobile, which leads to increased pollution levels. Additionally, as people continue to move out from the city, the city's tax base suffers, causing rundown in the infrastructure, vacant buildings, and substandard education and housing opportunities. Finally, most suburban landscapes in America today look similar, with the same fast food chains, big box stores, and shopping opportunities, leading to a homogenization of the American landscape.

More intensive production of agricultural goods in developing regions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(D) The Green Revolution refers to an agricultural revolution in which improved technology allowed for intensive cultivation of landscapes, particularly in the developing world. The new technologies consisted of herbicides and pesticides, hybrid seeds that could withstand some of the severe conditions present in places such as Africa and South Asia, and mechanical improvements such as irrigation.

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(B) GIS combine "geographic" (maps) with "information" (data tables) in one digital system that can integrate multiple layers of geospatial information. These layers can be manipulated or queried to conduct varying levels of spatial analysis. Consequently, GIS are dynamic, whereas traditional paper maps are typically static.</p>

The population of both countries is decreasing.</li><li>D. The population of both countries is not changing.</li><li>E. It depends on the total fertility rates in each country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(B) The demographic transition model describes population growth (or lack of growth) in a country over time. The model states that countries go through four stages before achieving stable growth. Stage 1 is characterized by high birth and death rates and little growth; in stage 2, the death rate declines, birth rate remains high, and growth increases; in stage 3, the birth rate begins to drop and the growth rate also drops, but the country still experiences growth; and finally, in stage 4, both birth and death rates are low and growth is stable, or sometimes even declining. Country A, in stage 1, is experiencing little growth, while Country B, in stage 2, is experiencing decreasing death rates with high birth rates, consequently rapid growth.</p>

<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>(D) Measures of social welfare generally indicate that the conditions for women in the least developed parts of the world are much worse than those of women in the highly developed regions. One such index, the Gender Empowerment Measure, developed by the United Nations, provides an overall picture of women's roles in different countries by looking at their participation in the labor force in professional and technical jobs, their influence in administrative and managerial positions, and their participation in government. According to this measure, women in more developed countries are much more likely to participate in government positions than their counterparts in developing parts of the globe.</p>

## Question 467

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 467</strong></p>
<p><b>7.</b> Agricultural production in the developed world is difficult to classify as part of the primary economy. Why?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. Production no longer happens primarily in a field but rather through high-tech methods such as hydroponics.</li><li>B. Agriculture is primarily controlled by large agribusinesses that encourage large-scale industrial production.</li><li>C. With so little of the labor force engaged in this economic activity, the category essentially no longer exists for the developed world.</li><li>D. Developed countries now outsource all of their agricultural production from the developing world.</li><li>E. Agricultural production is still very much a primary economic activity in the developed world, and its methods are comparable to those of the developing world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><b>(B)</b> Primary economic activities involve direct extraction of resources from the land. Modern-day agricultural production, particularly in the developed world, is difficult to categorize as a primary economic activity because of how industrialized it has become.</p>

<li>A. metropolitan-area theory.</li><li>B. sector theory.</li><li>C. central-place theory.</li><li>D. urban-matrix theory.</li><li>E. the rank-size rule.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><b>(C)</b> Central-place theory describes the organization of urban areas in a region or country. According to the theory, there should be a few large centers that provide a wide range of goods and services requiring a large market area (like a major-league baseball team). The central place is surrounded by a matrix of smaller cities, towns, and hamlets that offer progressively fewer products and enticements.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><b>(A)</b> The multiple-nuclei model describes urban areas that contain numerous centers of business and cultural activity rather than a single central place. As American communities have become increasingly suburbanized, commercial and cultural opportunities have spread to the suburbs, creating multiple nuclei of activity within one urban area.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Many of the most successful and sustainable population programs focus on which of the following as a means for curbing fertility rates?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. Establishing quotas on resources such as food, water, and land</li><li>B. Increasing access to sterilization procedures for males and females</li><li>C. Increasing women's access to education</li><li>D. Instituting penalties on families that have more than a designated number of children</li><li>E. Providing incentives to make it easier for women to stay at home with their children</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><b>(C)</b> As women gain access to education, employment opportunities in the formal economy open up to them. With more time invested in education and employment, less time is available to manage a family. Furthermore, as women become more educated, their awareness of family planning increases. Taken together, these factors lead to a dramatically lower fertility rate.</p>

<li>A. Sustainable</li><li>B. Modernization</li><li>C. Neoliberal</li><li>D. Dependency</li><li>E. Maturity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><b>(D)</b> The dependency theory of development describes a desire to become economically self-sufficient rather than relying on the problematic economic relationship set into play under colonization. Instead of relying on their colonizers for expensive manufactured imports, newly independent countries chose to develop a manufacturing base in order to substitute imports with domestically manufactured goods.</p>

If mortality is included with economics, as an economic indicator of development</li><li>E. As having nothing to do with development</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><b>(A)</b> Economic indicators of development typically describe measures of wealth, such as Gross National Product and Gross National Income. Social-welfare indicators demonstrate how a country is investing in the well-being of its population in terms of education, health, and other social services. Therefore, mortality rates are often seen as a social indicator of economic development.</p>

<p><strong>Question: 520</strong></p>
<p><b>15.</b> Domingo owns a piece of land in the US Southwest that he irrigated heavily in order to grow tomatoes. Domingo's land is now infertile. What process is most likely to have caused Domingo's soil to become unproductive?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. Gentrification</li><li>B. Deforestation</li><li>C. Salinization</li><li>D. Bromidification</li><li>E. Desertification</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><b>(C)</b> When farmers irrigate desert landscapes in an effort to increase productivity of an otherwise unproductive piece of land, the outcome typically involves salinization. The water applied to the land through irrigation evaporates quickly in the hot temperatures associated with these climates. After evaporation, a thick salty residue remains that renders the soil infertile. This process is what is meant by the term "salinization."</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><b>(B)</b> Increases in efficiency, including investments in technologies such as factory robots, have enabled output to continue growing since the 1970s even as employment has declined.

<p><strong>Question: 669</strong></p>
<p><b>14.</b> Agricultural production in North America is difficult to classify as part of the primary economy. Why?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. It is primarily controlled by large agribusinesses that encourage large-scale industrial production and investments in research and development.</li><li>B. It no longer happens primarily in a field but rather through high-tech methods such as hydroponics.</li><li>C. Because so little of the labor force is engaged in this economic activity, the category essentially no longer exists for the developed world.</li><li>D. It is still very much a primary economic activity with methods comparable to those evident in the developing world.</li><li>E. North America's soil is no longer suitable for agricultural production.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>—Most people do not move from rural areas into cities to seek a safer environment in which to raise their families or live. Urban crime rates exceed rural crime rates globally; people are aware of this and base their decisions accordingly. Potential employment opportunities (A) are the hope of most rural-to-urban migrants, but while jobs used to be more available in most cities, this is increasingly not always true. Better healthcare (B), generally available in urban areas, and the potential for a better education (C) are reasons why many migrants seek city life for their families.

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>—A basic assumption of this model says high birth and death rates will drop to lower levels over time as the country develops economically. It traces changes in fertility and mortality that occur as industrialization (not agricultural development) takes place (B). Thus it shows how population growth and economic development (not social development) are linked (E). Thomas Malthus's <em>Essay</em> <em>on the Principles of Population</em> states the world's population is growing faster than the food supply (D); his predictions did not take into account the declining birth rates of the <em>demographic transition</em> <em>model</em>. The <em>demographic transition model</em> has four stages (not six), with some demographers adding a fifth stage to show a continuing drop in the crude birth rate (CBR) seen in the aging populations of wealthier countries (E).</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>—While some cultural traits such as religious beliefs or food preferences determine production decisions, language does not. The physical environment (A) controls economic activity by limiting the type and availability of natural resources at a population's disposal. A government's decisions (C) to encourage (through tariffs and subsidies) or discourage economic activities (by limiting production, for example) greatly influence economic activities. The technology (D) available to a society also guides economic activities of a population. Market conditions of supply and demand (E), whether in a free market or government-controlled economy, strongly influence economic production.</p>

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 740</strong></p>
<p><b>9.</b> National anthems, flags, and holidays are all symbols that promote</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. irredentism.</li><li>B. nationalism.</li><li>C. supranationalism.</li><li>D. regionalism.</li><li>E. war.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>—Nationalism is a strong identification with one's country and what it stands for. National anthems, flags, national holidays, memorials, and even national sports teams all cement one's loyalty to a sovereign state and are strong centripetal forces in a country. Irredentism (A) is the claim by a country's government that an ethnic minority living in another country belongs to the homeland country. Strong irredentist unrest led to a war when Serbia stirred the fires of irredentism in Croatia among the ethnic Serb minority living there in the 1980s and 1990s. Supranationalism (C) is the current global trend for many countries to join organizations for a common goal or good. The United Nations is a well-known supranational organization. Regionalism (D) often develops when a minority group forms a majority in one region of a country and identifies more closely with its group than with the country. War (E) is not promoted by a flag or national symbol. Such iconography may stir nationalism in times of war, but these items do not encourage or promote war in themselves.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>C</strong>—Agribusiness is not a new or single corporate entity but rather a system (A) that involves a complex set of interrelationships to organize food production (B). It is a global enterprise (D) that is driven in large part by the global fast food industry (E), which requires low-priced farm products to be competitive and profitable.</p>

The world's population increases sharply with an increase in surface elevation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>—More than half of the world's population is concentrated on only 5 percent of the world's land area and two-thirds lives on only 10 percent of the land area. The world's population, in fact, is very unevenly distributed (A) with some parts of the world uninhabited and others very densely populated. The area between 60 degrees and 80 degrees north of the equator is sparsely inhabited because of a very cold climate (B). Over half the world's population lives north of the equator (C). The world's population drastically decreases in numbers with increases in elevation because of increasingly unfavorable living conditions (E).</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>—Megalopolis refers to an almost 600-mile-long conurbation stretching from southern Maine to southern Virginia. Several cities and their industrial and market-oriented businesses make up this conurbation. Megacity (B) is a term created in the 1970s to apply to very large cities with a population of 10 million or more that many thought would overwhelm the world's resources. Supercity (C) is the term given to Auckland, New Zealand, by its residents as the city boundaries continue to extend into the neighboring hinterlands, swallowing nearby towns and smaller cities.

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>—A compact state would have lower transportation and communication costs within the state, leading to more efficient transportation and communication systems. This can lead to greater cohesion among its population. A prorupt state (B) is mainly compact with a narrow extension protruding out of it. An elongated state (C) is long and narrow like Chile or Norway. A fragmented state (D) is composed of more than one disconnected piece of territory. Examples include island states such as Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as states like Italy with regions on both the mainland and on islands. All these shapes of states can be expected to have less efficient transportation and communication systems than a compact state.</p>

<p><strong>B</strong>—Agglomeration is process in which businesses cluster together to take advantage of infrastructure or markets. These three stores would likely locate near one another to attract shoppers who might also be interested in their goods. Deglomeration (C) refers to the spreading out of businesses because of crowding and other negatives. Purchasing power parity (A) refers to a formula used to compare the value of a product in various countries. Urban heat islands (D) refer to the increase in temperatures found in urban areas because of increased pavement, population density, and industrial activity.

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>—The <em>concentric zone model</em> depicts the city as a set of rings radiating out from the CBD and was developed to explain the social patterns of American cities in the 1920s. The central place model (B) was developed by German geographer Walter Christaller in 1933 to explain the patterns and distributions of settlements as they are interconnected with their surrounding hinterlands. The urban realms model (C) is an economic model that states an urban resident's life is mainly lived in one realm within the urban environment. The sector model (D) views urban housing like spokes radiating from a central hub. It states that new housing for the wealthy extends outward on its original axis from the city as it grows, middle-income housing extends in the same way next to higher-income sectors, and lower-income housing fills in the gaps. The <em>multiple-nuclei model</em> (E) states that large cities spread out from several nodes of growth, not just one.</p>

## Question 762

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 762</strong></p>
<p><b>1.</b> Which model below is based on the assumption that growth happens around several major foci, not just the CBD?</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. Central place model</li><li>B. Concentric zone model</li><li>C. Urban realms model</li><li>D. Sector model</li><li>E. Multiple-nuclei model</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> E</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>E</strong>—The <em>multiple-nuclei model</em> states that large cities spread out from several nodes of growth, not just one. The central place model (B) was developed by German geographer Walter Christaller in 1933 to explain the patterns and distributions of settlements as they are interconnected with their surrounding hinterlands. The <em>concentric zone model</em> (B) depicts the city as a set of rings radiating out from the CBD and was developed to explain the social patterns of American cities in the 1920s. The urban realms model (C) is an economic model that states an urban resident's life is mainly lived in one realm within the urban environment. The sector model (D) views urban housing like spokes radiating from a central hub (the CBD). It states that new housing for the wealthy extends outward on its original axis from the city as it grows, middle-income housing extends in the same way next to the higher-income sector, and lower-income housing fills in the gaps.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>—Primary activities such as mining, agriculture, fishing, forestry, and quarrying, involve humans harvesting crops or removing materials from the earth. Pottery production (A), electronic assembly (B), and hydroelectric production (C) are secondary activities that add value to the original material.

<li>A. birth rates.</li><li>B. death rates.</li><li>C. migration.</li><li>D. age structure.</li><li>E. calculation of the doubling time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> E</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>E</strong>—Doubling time is calculated by dividing the country's growth rate (as a percent) into 70. These calculations should never be relied on to accurately predict the future size of a population. Birth rates (A), death rates (B), migration (C), and age structure (D) are all important factors affecting the growth of a population.</p>

## Question 771

<div class="mcontent">
<p><strong>Question: 771</strong></p>
<p><b>10.</b> The worldwide trend towards using biofuels has caused all the following to occur EXCEPT</p>
<ul class="qlist">
<li>A. a decrease in use of fossil fuels.</li><li>B. a rise in global food prices.</li><li>C. the conversion of small farms to large monoculture plantations.</li><li>D. violence.</li><li>E. the eviction of small farmers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>—The development of biofuels has not caused a decrease in the use of fossil fuels as hoped; worldwide consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow, although at a slower pace than it would if biofuels had not been developed. However, the development of biofuels has caused a rise in global food prices as some farmland that used to grow food now produces crops for biofuels (B). In some parts of the world, the transfer of farmland to the production of crops for biofuels has also resulted in the conversion of small farms to large monoculture plantations (C), violence (D), and the eviction of small farmers (E).</p>
