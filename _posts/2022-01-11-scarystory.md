He originally thought his brother was at the garden and Pierce heard sounds of him working on the watering, but there was also a sound from the laundry room. It seemed like someone was there. Worried, Pierce rushed and found his brother sitting on a chair staring at the washing machine, when Pierce tapped his back, he creepily turned his neck and sinisterly smiled. Pierce ran outside but his brother was no longer working on the plants, about ten neighbors were around and he was laying unconscious in the middle of the road. After few melancholic days and nights, Pierce decides to go to the forest on his own. After a while, he saw a cabin, the cabin was in the middle of nowhere. Pierce went inside, and a foul smell went into his nose. There were dead bodies wrapped in black sheets all over the floor. In one of the sheets, he saw his brother.
