# Probability Question Contradiction

1. There is a wheel with four separate colors, and for some reason, the last three times, the color landed on pink, but what is the next color being pink’s probability.

2. You would say it is 1/4, but in fact, if four times, the color being is pink, then the probability is 1/256. So, what is actually the probability(probably a misconception)

3. If we take this as Russian roulette, then we hypothesize that three people before you in your team all got shot(four people in total in a team), then what’s the probability you get shot. As the probability of everyone in the team getting eliminated is very very low when confronted with the first person, the probability will increase if the first one gets shot, until if three people died, the probability of team destruction all depends on the last person, which is 1/6.

4. We can visit this idea by looking at the squid game. Before the old man, Oh Il Nam voted(we suppose there are 101 people in total), the votes were 50/50, but at last, it seems like the weight of Il Nam, at last, is 100%. The first person voting’s weight is theoretically 1%, and the second person’s weight is 2% if the votes were all equal at last. This summation adds to 100 until the last one, thus making Oh Il Nan’s decision the most important. Why is the probability more dependent on the ones afterward?

Also in Glass Stepping Stones, the probability of the first one dying is the most while 456 is the least possible to die

5. This is a separate strategy: at last on the wheel, we were first place ahead of everybody by 2 points. They have two choices, so the only way for them to tie with us is to put all two choices at one color of the wheel. This is technically a 25% chance. But we also have two choices to make, and the best choice here is for us to put two separate choices into two separate colors. If we get it correct, no one can catch up to us, thus the probability of us winning is just getting 1/2 or the probability of getting a correct answer when separating our two choices(never put two eggs in the same basket). So now, the probability of the other teams winning is just we getting the answer wrong and them getting it correct. This probability is 1/2 * 1/4 so it is 1/8. Meaning our chance of winning is 3/8 greater(4/8-1/8).

But if there are 4 groups in total, then it means one group must get it correct, so the chance of us winning is once again 1/2.
