# The feeling of sadness when something great end - Halloween BIGZ 2021

Going back home, going back to an airplane after an interesting day of Halloween and trip. This gives you a sense of grief and what are you gonna do next. What can you do next? Something ended, everyone gradually leaves while you see no more familiar faces. You feel guilt and grief as you think you could have done better using up your time. A great event as to a big movie with hundreds of people in the theatre, turn out to be empty while everything gets erased by a breeze and memories will trouble your mind. Places filled with people no longer stay the same. Your friends leave, you find a new friend. Until they are no longer in sight. This marks the end of a remarkable ‘era’. This marks the feeling of eternal desolation. To make scenarios like this, then you need to build a big event with lots of people. And then, people will leave slowly. People will be separated and when everyone goes, then you wouldn’t see them until a long time. This is what makes it pathetic.
